# injectr #

_Finally, a solution to node.js dependency injection_

## Install it ##

`npm install injectr`. Boom.

## Use it ##

````javascript
var injectr = require('injectr');
var myScript = injectr('./lib/myScript.js', {
    fs : mockFs,
    crypto : mockCrypto
});
````

Now when you `require('fs')` or `require('crypto')` in myScript.js, what you get
is `mockFs` or `mockCrypto`. It works with relative requires too. Just make
sure you make the property name exactly the same as what is required in the
file being tested.

Treat **injectr** like `require` for your tests, with a second argument to pass
in your mocks. The only thing to note is that paths are relative to the
_working directory_, not to the file location as with `require`.
